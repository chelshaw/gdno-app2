# Gardenio App

React-Native app created with Expo (bare workflow).

# Getting Started

1. Pull down the repo

2. `yarn install` inside the root directory
    Note: Make sure your node version is set to 10.15.3

3. `cd ios; pod install` to install the ios podfiles

## Simulating iOS

1. Open XCode (currently running 10.3)

2. File > Open > gdno.xcworkspace

3. Select an iOS Simulator

4. Click the "play" icon

Play should start the metro bundler (same thing as running `yarn start`) and boot up the Simulator app automatically. You may instead run `yarn start` and then go through this process.

Note: to start or stop debugging in the browser, you can do âŒ˜d while in the simulator and choose to start or stop the debug

In order to test in non-debug mode (build), select or create a different scheme from the dropdown in XCode

## Simulating Android

There are two ways to do this. One, is to have a device, put it in debug mode (check online for how to do this for your device), connect it to the computer, and then run `yarn android`. Otherwise you must use an IDE such as Android Studio:

1. Open this project in Android Studio

2. Open the AVD (Android Virtual Device) Manager

3. Click the "play" icon on the virtual device you'd like to simulate. If you don't have any, click "Create Virtual Device" and go through the wizard

4. Run `adb devices` to see emulators connected (both when simulation running or plugged in via USB). Install `adb` command with `brew install android-platform-tools`

5. Once you've confirmed there is an emulator available, go back to the terminal and run `yarn android`
